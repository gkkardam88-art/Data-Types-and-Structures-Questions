        "  - Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Tuples ensure data integrity because they are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after creation.\n",
        "This prevents accidental modification, keeps the data safe, and makes it reliable for storing fixed information.\n",

        "8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
        "  - Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "  A hash table is a data structure that stores data using a key → hash value → memory location system.\n",
        "Python dictionaries use a hash table internally, which means each key is converted into a hash value that decides where its value is stored.\n",
        "\n",
        "This makes dictionary operations like searching, inserting, and deleting very fast.\n",

        "Yes, lists can contain different data types in Python.\n",

        "10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python.\n",
        "  - Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Strings are immutable in Python to improve performance, memory efficiency, and security.\n",
        "Because they cannot be changed after creation, Python can safely reuse them, avoid accidental modifications, and make operations like hashing and storing strings faster and more reliable.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n",
        "  - Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Dictionaries let you access data using keys instead of indexes, which is faster and more meaningful.\n",
        "\n",
        "* They store data as key–value pairs, making it easy to look up information quickly.\n",
        "\n",
        "* They provide very fast search, insert, and delete operations because they use a hash table internally.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\n",
        "  - Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "  A tuple is preferable when you want to store fixed data that should not change, such as coordinates of a point (10, 20) or days of the week.\n",
        "  \n",
        "Since tuples are immutable, they protect the data from accidental modification, ensuring it stays constant throughout the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
        "  - Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Sets automatically remove duplicate values.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you add the same value more than once, the set keeps only one copy, because sets store only unique elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n",
        "  - Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        " * In a list, the in keyword checks if a value exists in the list.\n",
        "Example: 5 in [1, 2, 5] → checks for the value 5.\n",
        "\n",
        "* In a dictionary, the in keyword checks only for keys, not values.\n",
        "Example: \"name\" in {\"name\": \"Aman\"} → checks for the key \"name\".\n",
        "\n",
        "15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not.\n",
        "  - Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "*  No, you cannot modify the elements of a tuple because tuples are immutable.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Once a tuple is created, its values cannot be changed, added, or removed.\n",
        "\n",
        "* This immutability helps protect data from accidental modification and ensures data integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n",
        "  - Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "  A nested dictionary is a dictionary that contains another dictionary as its value.\n",
        "It is used to store complex or structured data in multiple levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example use case:\n",
        "\n",
        "Storing student information where each student has details like name, age, and marks:\n",
        "\n",
        "students = {\n",
        "    \"student1\": {\"name\": \"Aman\", \"age\": 20, \"marks\": 85},\n",

        "\n",
        "17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.\n",
        "  - Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Accessing an element in a Python dictionary has an average time complexity of O(1), meaning it takes constant time.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is because dictionaries use a hash table, which allows Python to find the value directly using the key’s hash.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the worst case (very rare), it can be O(n) due to hash collisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n",
        "  - Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Lists are preferred when:\n",
        "\n",
        "* You need to store ordered data.\n",
        "\n",
        "* You want to access items by position (index).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Your data does not require key–value pairs.\n",
        "\n",
        "* You need a simple, sequential collection like names, numbers, or items in a queue.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n",
        "  - Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Dictionaries are considered unordered because their items are stored based on hash values, not fixed positions or indexes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since the data is placed according to the key’s hash, you cannot access items by index like in a list.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead, you access data only by its key, which makes retrieval fast but not position-based.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n",
        "  - Answer:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval\n",
        "\n",
        "* List: You retrieve data using an index, which is a number showing the position of the item (e.g., my_list[0]).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Dictionary: You retrieve data using a key, which is a unique identifier for the value (e.g., my_dict[\"name\"]).\n",
